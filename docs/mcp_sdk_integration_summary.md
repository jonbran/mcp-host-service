# MCP SDK Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Added MCP SDK Dependency**

   - Added `mcp>=1.9.0` to requirements.txt
   - Ensured compatibility with existing dependencies

2. **Created SDK Client Implementation**

   - Implemented `MCPSdkClient` class that wraps the official SDK
   - Added support for all transport types: STDIO, SSE, and HTTP
   - Implemented authentication handling for HTTP transport

3. **Created SDK Host Implementation**

   - Implemented `MCPSdkHost` class for orchestrating MCP interactions
   - Maintained compatibility with the existing API
   - Integrated with the model service

4. **Updated Configuration Support**

   - Added HTTP transport type support
   - Added authentication configuration
   - Updated validators

5. **API Integration**

   - Updated API router to use the new MCP SDK Host
   - Maintained backward compatibility

6. **Scheduler Service Integration**

   - Created utility scripts for managing the Scheduler service:
     - `update_scheduler_config.py`
     - `start_scheduler.py`
   - Implemented authentication support for the Scheduler service
   - Added test scripts:
     - `test_scheduler_mcp.py`
     - `test_scheduler_auth.py`
     - `test_scheduler_integration.py`
     - `test_mcp_sdk_integration.py`

7. **Scheduler Service Wrapper**

   - Created `SchedulerService` class for simplified interaction
   - Implemented methods for scheduling, checking, and canceling conversations
   - Added example script demonstrating its usage

8. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the MCP SDK integration
   - Added examples and usage instructions
   - Included troubleshooting information

## Benefits

1. **Standardization**: Using the official MCP SDK ensures better compatibility with the MCP specification
2. **Enhanced Transport**: Added support for HTTP transport with authentication
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Simplified code by leveraging the official SDK
4. **Better Security**: Added support for authentication when needed
5. **Scheduler Integration**: Added support for scheduling future conversations

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - Test the integration with real Scheduler service
   - Verify authentication works correctly
   - Test scheduling actual conversations

2. **Monitoring**:

   - Consider adding monitoring for scheduled conversations
   - Track successful/failed deliveries

3. **User Interface**:

   - Develop UI components for scheduling conversations
   - Display scheduled conversations

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update user-facing documentation
   - Create developer tutorials

## Future Enhancements

1. **Retry Logic**: Add retry logic for failed conversation deliveries
2. **Bulk Operations**: Support scheduling multiple conversations
3. **Templates**: Add support for conversation templates
4. **Event Notifications**: Implement callbacks or webhooks for conversation events
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Create an admin dashboard for monitoring and managing scheduled conversations
