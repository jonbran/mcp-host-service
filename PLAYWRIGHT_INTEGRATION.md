# Playwright MCP Server Integration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **API Integration**

   - Created `/api/playwright` endpoint for direct interaction with Playwright MCP server
   - Updated `/api/models` endpoint to include MCP servers in the providers list

2. **Configuration**

   - Added Playwright MCP server configuration in `config/config.json`
   - Created a script to ensure proper configuration (`scripts/update_playwright_config.py`)

3. **Documentation**

   - Created detailed documentation in `docs/playwright_mcp.md`
   - Updated `README.md` to include information about the Playwright MCP server
   - Added API usage examples and testing instructions

4. **Testing**
   - Completed `tests/test_playwright_mcp_server.py` to verify the integration
   - Created a test runner script (`scripts/test_playwright_integration.py`)

## Testing the Integration

1. **Ensure the Playwright MCP server is properly configured:**

   ```bash
   python scripts/update_playwright_config.py
   ```

2. **Install the Playwright MCP server (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Run the integration test:**

   ```bash
   python scripts/test_playwright_integration.py --start-service
   ```

   This will:

   - Start the MCP host service (if not already running)
   - Run the Playwright MCP server test
   - Report the results

4. **Manual Testing:**
   - Start the MCP host service:
     ```bash
     uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
     ```
   - Check that the Playwright MCP server is listed in the providers:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:8001/api/models
     ```
   - Test a basic screenshot operation:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/playwright \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "type": "tool",
         "name": "screenshot",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://example.com",
           "output_path": "example_screenshot.png"
         }
       }'
     ```

## Usage in Applications

See the documentation in `docs/playwright_mcp.md` for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Next Steps

1. **Advanced Testing:** Test additional Playwright MCP tools beyond the basic screenshot functionality.
2. **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error handling for the Playwright integration.
3. **UI Integration:** Create a UI component to visualize and interact with the Playwright capabilities.
4. **CI/CD Integration:** Add Playwright MCP server tests to the CI/CD pipeline.
